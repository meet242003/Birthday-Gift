                <p>Hey Shiva! 🎉</p>
                <p>You've been one of the rare constants in my life. The person I can go to when the world feels heavier
                    than usual, the one who listens with patience, laughs with intention, and somehow knows how to
                    steady my thoughts without even trying.</p>
                <p>I don't say this often, but your presence genuinely makes life feel lighter. Thank you for being
                    there in moments when I didn't even know how to explain what I was feeling. Thank you for showing
                    up, for checking in, for being the quiet strength on the days I struggled to find my own.</p>
                <p>People like you are not common. You're the kind of person who brings clarity just by being
                    themselves. And I want you to know this — I'm always here for you. No matter the hour, the
                    situation, or the chaos. You never have to think twice about reaching out.</p>
                <p>You deserve people who choose you with intention, and I hope I can be one of those people in your
                    life. You're a genuinely rare soul. A gem in the most effortless way.</p>
                <p class="final-wish">🎂 Happy Birthday, Shivani! May all your dreams come true! ✨</p>
